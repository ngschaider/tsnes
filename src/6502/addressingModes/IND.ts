// Address Mode: Indirect
// The supplied 16-bit address is read to get the actual 16-bit address. This is
// instruction is unusual in that it has a bug in the hardware! To emulate its
// function accurately, we also need to emulate this bug. If the low byte of the
// supplied address is 0xFF, then to read the high byte of the actual address
// we need to cross a page boundary. This doesnt actually work on the chip as 
// designed, instead it wraps back around in the same page, yielding an 
// invalid actual address

// From the Datasheet:
// In the zero page indirect addressing mode, the second byte
// of the instruction points to a memory location on page zero
// containing the low-order byte of the effective address. The
// next location on page zero contains the high-order byte of
// the effective address.
