// From the Datasheet:
// INDEXED ABSOLUTE ADDRESSING [ABS, X or Y]
// This form of addressing is used in conjunction 
// with X and Y index register and is referred to 
// as "Absolute, X" and "Absolute, Y". The effective 
// address is formed by adding the contents of X or Y 
// to the address contained in the second and third 
// bytes of the instruction. This mode allows the 
// index register to contain the index or count value 
// and the instruction to contain the base address. 
// This type of indexing allows referencing of any 
// location and the index may modify multiple fields, 
// resulting in reduced coding and execution time.
