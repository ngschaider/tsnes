// INDIRECT INDEXED ADDRESSING [(IND), Y]
// In indirect indexed addressing (referred to as (Indirect), Y)), 
// the second byte of the instruction points to a memory location 
// in page zero. The contents of this memory location are added to 
// the contents of index register Y. The result is the low order 
// byte of the effective address. The carry from this addition is 
// added to the contents of the next page zero memory location, to 
// form the high order byte of the effective address.
