// ABSOLUTE INDIRECT [Indirect]
// The second byte of the instruction contains 
// the low order byte of a memory location. 
// The high order eight bits of that memory 
// location are contained in the third byte 
// of the instruction. The contents of the 
// fully specified memory location are the 
// low order byte of the effective address. 
// The next memory location contains the high 
// order byte of the effective address which 
// is loaded into the sixteen bits of the 
// program counter. (JMP (IND) only)
