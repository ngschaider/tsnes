// From the Datasheet:
// INDEXED ZERO PAGE ADDRESSING [ZP, X or Y]
// This form of addressing is used with the index register and is 
// referred to as "Zero Page, X" or "Zero Page, Y". The effective 
// address is calculated by adding the second byte to the contents 
// of the index register. Since this is a form of "Zero Page" addressing, 
// the contents of the second byte references a location in page zero. 
// Additionally, due to the "Zero Page" addressing nature of this 
// mode, no carry is added to the high-order eight bits of memory, 
// and crossing of page boundaries does not occur.
