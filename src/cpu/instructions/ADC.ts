///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// INSTRUCTION IMPLEMENTATIONS

// Note: Ive started with the two most complicated instructions to emulate, which
// Ive tried to include a detailed explanation as to why addition and subtraction 
// are so complex, yet so fundamental. Im also NOT going to do this through the 
// explanation of 1 and 2's complement.

// Instruction: Add with Carry In
// Function:    A = A + M + C
// Flags Out:   C, V, N, Z
//
// Explanation:
// The purpose of this function is to add a value to the accumulator and a carry bit. If
// the result is > 255 there is an overflow setting the carry bit. This allows you to
// chain together ADC instructions to add numbers larger than 8-bits. This in itself is
// simple, however the 6502 supports the concepts of Negativity/Positivity and Signed Overflow.
//
// 10000100 = 128 + 4 = 132 in normal circumstances, we know this as unsigned and it allows
// us to represent numbers between 0 and 255 (given 8 bits). The 6502 can also interpret 
// this word as something else if we assume those 8 bits represent the range -128 to +127,
// i.e. it has become signed.
//
// Since 132 > 127, it effectively wraps around, through -128, to -124. This wraparound is
// called overflow, and this is a useful to know as it indicates that the calculation has
// gone outside the permissable range, and therefore no longer makes numeric sense.
//
// Note the implementation of ADD is the same in binary, this is just about how the numbers
// are represented, so the word 10000100 can be both -124 and 132 depending upon the 
// context the programming is using it in. We can prove this!
//
//  10000100 =  132  or  -124
// +00010001 = + 17      + 17
//  ========    ===       ===     See, both are valid additions, but our interpretation of
//  10010101 =  149  or  -107     the context changes the value, not the hardware!
//
// In principle under the -128 to 127 range:
// 10000000 = -128, 11111111 = -1, 00000000 = 0, 00000000 = +1, 01111111 = +127
// therefore negative numbers have the most significant set, positive numbers do not
//
// To assist us, the 6502 can set the overflow flag, if the result of the addition has
// wrapped around. V <- ~(A^M) & A^(A+M+C) :D lol, let's work out why!
//
// Let's suppose we have A = 30, M = 10 and C = 0
//          A = 30 = 00011110
//          M = 10 = 00001010+
//     RESULT = 40 = 00101000
//
// Here we have not gone out of range. The resulting significant bit has not changed.
// So let's make a truth table to understand when overflow has occurred. Here I take
// the MSB of each component, where R is RESULT.
//
// A  M  R | V | A^R | A^M |~(A^M) | 
// 0  0  0 | 0 |  0  |  0  |   1   |
// 0  0  1 | 1 |  1  |  0  |   1   |
// 0  1  0 | 0 |  0  |  1  |   0   |
// 0  1  1 | 0 |  1  |  1  |   0   |  so V = ~(A^M) & (A^R)
// 1  0  0 | 0 |  1  |  1  |   0   |
// 1  0  1 | 0 |  0  |  1  |   0   |
// 1  1  0 | 1 |  1  |  0  |   1   |
// 1  1  1 | 0 |  0  |  0  |   1   |
//
// We can see how the above equation calculates V, based on A, M and R. V was chosen
// based on the following hypothesis:
//       Positive Number + Positive Number = Negative Result -> Overflow
//       Negative Number + Negative Number = Positive Result -> Overflow
//       Positive Number + Negative Number = Either Result -> Cannot Overflow
//       Positive Number + Positive Number = Positive Result -> OK! No Overflow
//       Negative Number + Negative Number = Negative Result -> OK! NO Overflow
