// Address Mode: Absolute with X Offset
// Fundamentally the same as absolute addressing, but the contents of the X Register
// is added to the supplied two byte address. If the resulting address changes
// the page, an additional clock cycle is required

// From the Datasheet:
// For absolute adressing, the second byte of the instruction
// specifies the eight low-order bits of the effective address,
// while the third byte specifies the eight high-order bits.
// Therefore, this addressing mode allows access to the total
// 64K bytes of addressable memory
