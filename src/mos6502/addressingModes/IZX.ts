// Address Mode: Indirect X
// The supplied 8-bit address is offset by X Register to index
// a location in page 0x00. The actual 16-bit address is read 
// from this location

// From the Datasheet:
// With absolute indexed indirect addressing the contents of
// the second and third instruction bytes are added to the X
// register. The result of this addition, points to a memory
// location containing the lower-order eight bits of the 
// effective address. The next memory location contains the
// higher-order eight bits of the effective address.
