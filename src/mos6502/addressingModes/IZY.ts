// Address Mode: Indirect Y
// The supplied 8-bit address is offset by Y Register to index
// a location in page 0x00. The actual 16-bit address is read 
// from this location

// From the Datasheet:
// This form of addressing is usually referred to as Indirect, Y.
// The second byte of the instruction points to a memory location
// in page zero. The contents of this memory location are added
// to the contents of the Y index register, the result beingt the
// low-order eight bits of the effective address. The carry from
// this addition is added to the contents of the next page zero
// location, the result being the high-order eight bits of the 
// effective address.
